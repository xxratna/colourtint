# colourtint
Edit your images and give them colour tint like in photo editing apps, but in MATLAB. 

Editing images in photo editing apps are easy and convenient, but sometimes it comes at the cost of compromising the image quality. Doing it on Photoshop allows for many customisations, but it can take a long time to process and does not allow for batch processing if you ever need to do that. In this guide, you can do basic editing for your photos and apply custom colour tints on MATLAB in a single run. This tutorial will provide you with the knowledge and tools to create beautiful, custom-tinted images on MATLAB.

It might take a bit of work and tweaking compared to using traditional image editor, but it is a good practise and exploration of basic image processing in MATLAB.
