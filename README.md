# colourtint
Edit your images and give them colour tint like in photo editing apps, but in MATLAB. 

Check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/xxratna/colourtint/wiki) for the tutorial!

The full code can be seen [here](https://github.com/xxratna/colourtint/blob/main/colourtint_matlab.m)!

I will show you how to go from the original image on the left to the colour-tinted image on the right.
